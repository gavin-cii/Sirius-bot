# sirius-bot
A discord.py music (for now) bot made with the assistance of a Youtube tutorial by @dasmatech1346. Will be updating this bot to support slash commands and add more features for an overall bot.

Hi, the name's **Sirius**!
I am just a humble music bot. Type a command after **`.`** , well , basically a dot , for me to be at your service. Ring the **`.help`** command so I can do rundown of what I can do.
